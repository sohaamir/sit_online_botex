        <h2><b>How do I know which image to choose?</b></h2>
        <br>
        <p>In each round, one image will reward you whilst the other will lower your score. <b>Which image does which is the same for all players in the group.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>In the game, the 60 rounds are split into a number of 'blocks'. Within each block, both images will give you wins and losses,<b> but one image will give you more wins than the other.</b>
            <br>
            <div class="red-highlight-box">
                <p><b>However, this will switch multiple times across the game, such that the 'better' image will become the 'worse' image and vice versa.</b></p>
       </div>
       <br>
            <p>For example, whilst it may be better <b>overall</b> to choose the 'Green' image than the 'Blue' image in one block, in the next block it will be the other way round.</p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p><b>This is a very important aspect of the game</b>, because if the image gave you the same outcome everytime in each block, you would always know which one to pick and when exactly the reversals happen!</p>
        <br>
        <div class="blue-highlight-box">
                 <p><b>The challenge of the game is that when and how often the switches take place are unknown to you.</b></p>
            <p>You should therefore pay attention to the feedback and adjust your choices accordingly.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Over the course of the game, you may choose to <b>either trust your own learning experience through trial and error and/or 
            take decisions from others into consideration,</b> as some of the other players might learn faster than others.</p>

        <div class="blue-highlight-box">
            <p>After completing 60 rounds, the total number of points you earned will be displayed along with your bonus,
