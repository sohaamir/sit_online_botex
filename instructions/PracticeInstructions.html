        <h1><b>Practice Game Instructions</b></h1>
        <br>
        <p><b>To get familiar with the task, you will now get to play 4 practice rounds with four other players.</b></p>
        <br>
        <div class="blue-highlight-box">
            <p>The practice game is set up in the same way as the main game, but there are <b>no switches.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is just to get familiar with how the game works: which buttons to press and when.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The <b>time provided for each of the individual sections is also longer</b> in the practice game (approximately 6 seconds per choice), 
                compared to the actual game (3 seconds per choice), so you can understand the different components and have more time to make your decisions.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>The practice task itself will last approximately 4 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Please also change the size of your browser window during this practice session to match the page if needed.</b>
        <p>You should be able to see the white boundaries around the page as demonstrated below:</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="{% static 'instructions/example_dimensions.png' %}" alt="Bet 2" width="800" height="auto" class="bordered-image">
            </div>
        <br>
        <p><b>Please ensure that these white boundaries are correctly proportioned to your screen, so you can see all of the images well.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>When you are ready, press the next button when you are ready to play the practice game. We will put you into a waiting room where you will be matched with four other players.</p> 
        <p><b>It should take no longer than a minute or two to be matched (which is factored into your payment).</b></p>
