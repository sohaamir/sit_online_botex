        <h2><b>Practice Game Instructions</b></h2>
        <br>
        <p>To get familiar with the task, you will now get to play 10 practice rounds. <b>Importantly, you will be playing against two computers and not other players.</b>
            Subsequently, the images will be dimmer in all cases for other players, indicative of when the choices are made by the computer.</p>
    <br>
        <p>In this practice game, the probability of reward is different for the two images, with one more likely to give reward than the other, but this does not switch, as there are only 10 trials.</p>
        <br>

        <p>The time provided for each of the individual sections is also longer in the practice game (approximately 3-4 seconds per decision), compared to the actual game (between 2-3 seconds per decision), so you can understand the different components.</p>

        <p>Please press the next button when you are ready to play the practice game. It should take no longer than 2 minutes.</p>
