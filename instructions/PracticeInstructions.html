        <p><b>To get familiar with the task, you will now get to play 10 practice rounds with two other players.</b></p>
        <br>
        <div class="blue-highlight-box">
            <p>In this practice game, as with the main task, <b>the probability of reward is different for the two images,</b> with one more likely to give reward than the other.
                However unlike the main task, <b>this does not switch,</b> as there are only 10 trials.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The <b>time provided for each of the individual sections is also longer</b> in the practice game (approximately 3-4 seconds per decision), 
                compared to the actual game (between 2-3 seconds per decision), so you can understand the different components and have more time to make your decisions.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Please press the next button when you are ready to play the practice game. We will put you into a waiting room where you will be matched with two other players.</p> 
        <p><b>It should take no longer than a few minutes to be matched (which is factored into your payment).</b></p> 
        <br>
        <p>The practice task itself will last approximately 3 minutes.</p>
