        <div class="blue-highlight-box">
            <p>In this experiment you will be presented with choosing between two images, which have different probabilities of giving a reward. 
                Importantly, if you select an image which does not provide a reward, then you will lose points for that trial. 
                It is therefore important, in order to gain as many points as possible, to try and select the image which is more likely to give you a reward.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>However, the image more likely to provide the reward <b>will switch at certain points throughout,</b> as will the position of the images on the screen.
            It is therefore important that you <b>do not repeatedly press the same button,</b> as you will lose more points that way.</p>
        
        <p>You will be playing with <b>two other players of the same gender</b>, who will also make the same choices at the same time. You may or may not choose to take their choices into account when making your own.</p>

        <p>The experiment will be split into two parts: <b>a practice game and the main task</b>. 
            The practice game will allow you to familiarise yourself with the task and how it works, 
            while the main task will be the part of the task where you will earn points <b>of which a certain proportion of top scorers will be rewarded with a bonus payment.</b></p>
        <br>
        <div class="red-highlight-box">
            <p>The practice game will last approximately 3 minutes, and the main task approximately 35 minutes. In total, the experiment will last around 50 minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
             Please ensure that the browser window covers your entire screen so the experiment runs smoothly.</p>

        <br>
        <p>We will now describe how the main task works. Please press the next button when you are ready to move onto the task instructions.</p>
