        <br>
        <p>At the beginning of each round, you will be presented with the screen below, where you will make your first choice for <b>which image you think will give a reward.</b></p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="{% static 'instructions/TaskInstructionsPage1/choice1.png' %}" alt="Choice 1" width="600" height="auto">
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>The two images have different probabilities of giving a reward, with one being more likely to give a reward, and the other more likely to give a loss.
            Which image gives which is randomly determined at the start, but they will switch at certain points throughout the task.</p>
        <br>

        <p>The other four players in the group are represented by the avatars, <b>with each group consisting of same-gender participants.</b></p>
        <br>
        <div class="blue-box">
            <p><b>The position of the other players on the screen does not change throughout the experiment such that Player 1 is always on the far left followed by Players 2 and 3, and Player 4 on the far right.</b></p>

        <p>You will have 2.5 seconds to make this first choice between the two images. This is done by either pressing the 'Left' or 'Right' keys on your keyboard. <b>Importantly, you cannot change your choice once it is made</b>.
            If you do not make a choice within this time limit, an image will be selected at random for you.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The chosen image is highlighted with a yellow box when you make your choice, or when it has been made for you.</p>
        <div class="dual-image-container">

        <br>
        <p>You will then be asked to place a 'bet' as to <b>how confident you are</b> that the image selected is the image with the higher probability of reward. 
            This is done by pressing either the '1', '2' or '3' button on your keyboard.
            <b>You cannot change your bet once it is made.</b></p>

        <p><b>Again, you have 2.5 seconds to make your bet. If you do not make a bet within this time, a random bet will be placed for you.</b></p>

        <p>The chosen bet is highlighted with a yellow box when the bet is made.</p>

            The avatar for the player selected as the 'first preference' is subsequently highlighted with a red box.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You then select another player's choice to uncover second by pressing either '1', '2', '3' or '4'. The avatar for this second player is highlighted with an orange box. 
            <b>You must select two different players and cannot choose the same player twice.</b></p>
        <p>You will have 2 seconds to choose each, a random choice will be made for you if you do not make either choice within this time.</p>
