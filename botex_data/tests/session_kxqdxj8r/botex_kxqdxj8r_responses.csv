kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,1,id_comprehension_q1,minus 60 points,A bet of 3 results in a loss of 60 points if the choice is incorrect.
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,1,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,The instruction asks to select Option 3.
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,1,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,The instructions state that the final score is randomly chosen from either the first or second attempt.
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,1,id_comprehension_q4,"One option will give you a reward randomly, and the other will give you a loss randomly",This is the most logical option given the nature of the experiment.
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,1,id_choice1,A,I'm choosing option A arbitrarily for my first choice. My choice in round 2 will be influenced by other players' choices and the comprehension check.
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,1,id_bet1,2,I will start with a moderate bet to balance risk and reward.  I will adjust this based on the others' choices and my confidence level in round 2.
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,1,id_choice2,A,"Three out of four other players chose option A initially. While this doesn't guarantee that A is the better choice in this round (because the reward is probabilistic), this information influences my decision to choose A again.  I am trying to maximize the points I earn."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,1,id_bet2,2,"Given that three out of four other players chose option A in the first round, I suspect option A is more likely to be the rewarded option.  However, since the reward is probabilistic, I will slightly lower my bet to 2 to mitigate potential losses, should option B be the rewarded option this round.  I'm hedging my bet based on the other player's choices."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,2,id_choice1,A,"Following the trend from the previous round, where option A was selected by most participants and yielded a successful outcome, I will choose option A again. While the probabilistic nature of the reward system makes it risky to bet solely on trend, it appears to offer a higher chance of success."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,2,id_bet1,2,"In the previous round, a bet of 2 yielded a positive outcome with option A.  While the reward is probabilistic, this cautious approach seems reasonable considering the lack of consistent patterns across rounds."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,2,id_choice2,A,"Three out of four players chose option A initially. Although the reward mechanism is probabilistic, the majority choice might indicate a higher likelihood of success.  My own successful experience with option A in the first round reinforces this choice.  Therefore, I'm sticking with option A."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,2,id_bet2,2,"In the first round, betting 2 on option A yielded a successful outcome.  While the reward is probabilistic, the previous success with option A and a bet of 2 suggests it's a relatively safe and potentially rewarding strategy.  Choosing a bet of 2 maintains a balance between risk and reward.  Lowering the bet to 1 would limit potential gains, whereas increasing to 3 would increase potential losses."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,3,id_choice1,A,"Option A has yielded positive results in the previous two rounds. While the reward is probabilistic, the observed pattern suggests a higher likelihood of success with option A. This is a continuation of a winning strategy, although not guaranteed."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,3,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 reflects a balanced approach to risk and reward, considering the probabilistic nature of the outcomes.  While option A has shown success in previous rounds, a cautious bet prevents significant point loss if the pattern shifts."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,3,id_choice2,A,"Although the other players' choices are more divided this round (two chose A and two chose B), I will stick with option A. My reasoning is based on the consistent success of choosing A in the previous rounds, despite the probabilistic nature of the reward.  Option A has shown a tendency towards positive outcomes, therefore my decision is to maintain a consistency with my previous strategies."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,3,id_bet2,2,"In the previous rounds, a bet of 2 has proven successful.  While the other players' choices are more spread out this round, I will maintain a cautious approach with a bet of 2 to balance potential reward and risk. I will stick to my strategy that has proven successful in previous rounds, adjusting the bet according to what the other players do. I am sticking to bet 2 because it worked in two previous rounds."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,4,id_choice1,A,"The previous rounds show that option A has been correct more often than option B (2/3 times correct). Therefore, based on this pattern, I will continue to choose option A."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,4,id_bet1,2,"In the previous three rounds, I selected option A with a bet of 2. In rounds 1 and 2, this resulted in a gain of 40 points. In round 3, it resulted in a loss of 40 points.  However, the pattern of choosing option A suggests it's the better choice in the long run. Although a probabilistic element exists, I maintain the bet of 2 as a balanced approach, aiming for a higher chance of reward with lower risk than a bet of 3 and a greater potential payoff than a bet of 1."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,4,id_choice2,A,"The majority of players (3 out of 4) initially chose option A. Although this isn't a guarantee of success, it suggests a higher probability of a positive outcome compared to option B.  This aligns with my successful experiences in previous rounds where A was the favored choice."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,4,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 reflects a balanced approach to risk and reward, given the probabilistic nature of the outcomes and the previous rounds' results.  A bet of 2 has yielded both wins and losses, providing a good balance of points gain versus potential loss.  A higher bet may lead to greater reward but also higher losses. A lower bet limits potential losses but also limits potential gain."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,5,id_choice1,A,"In the previous rounds, option A has consistently shown a higher probability of success, even though it's not guaranteed.  While the probabilistic nature of the rewards means no option is always correct, the data suggests option A is the more favorable choice."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,5,id_bet1,2,"Based on the previous rounds, choosing option A with a bet of 2 has yielded a balanced approach to risk and reward. While not always successful, it has shown a higher probability of success compared to higher bets.  A bet of 1 is too cautious, and a bet of 3 too risky, given the probabilistic nature of the rewards."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,5,id_choice2,A,"My reasoning for choosing A again is based on the results of the previous rounds. Although the outcome is probabilistic, option A has shown a higher likelihood of success.  While not all players chose A initially in this round, three players did, suggesting a higher likelihood of A being the better choice."
kxqdxj8r,exstmevt,5,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 reflects a balanced approach to risk and reward, consistent with my strategy in previous rounds.  While the other players' choices show some variation,  option A has shown a higher probability of success, although the reward is probabilistic. A bet of 2 allows for a reasonable gain if A is correct, while limiting potential losses if it is not."
