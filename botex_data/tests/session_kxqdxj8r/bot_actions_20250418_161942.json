Based on my previous experience in Round 1, where I chose A with a bet of 2 and succeeded, I will make my initial choice and bet with a similar strategy. I'm selecting option A and will bet 2.  My reasoning for this choice is that in the previous round, choosing option A led to a successful outcome, and this pattern seems to hold some weight in the context of the experiment. However,  I still remain cautious given the probabilistic nature of rewards and risks, hence, a bet of 2 seems balanced. In Round 2, I reviewed the other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A with a bet of 2.  For my second choice, I chose A (id_choice2) with a bet of 2 (id_bet2). My reasoning for maintaining my choice of A is that while one player chose B, the majority still opted for A, which aligns with my initial assessment and successful outcome in Round 1.  A bet of 2 continues to represent a balanced approach to risk and reward. In Round 2, my second choice (Option A with a bet of 2) was correct, and I gained 40 points.

My reasoning is based on the successful outcomes in the previous rounds, where option A consistently yielded a positive result with a bet of 2.  This strategy seems to be working well and provides a balance between potential rewards and minimized risk. In Round 3, I see the other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my bet was 2.

Question 1 asked about the points earned/lost for a second choice of 3, resulting in an incorrect option. I answered '-60 points', which was correct. Question 2 was a catch question to select Option 3, which I answered correctly. Question 3 asked how the bonus payment is calculated, and I answered that it is randomly chosen from either the first or second choice/bet, which was also correct. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of reward/loss for each option in each block. My answer that 'One option will give you a reward randomly, and the other will give you a loss randomly' was incorrect. The correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time; the reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. This means I need to treat both my initial and revised choices and bets as if both contribute to my final score because it is randomly chosen from either my first choice and bet or my second choice and bet. I have now transitioned to the task, which consists of 5 rounds. In Round 1, I selected option A with a bet of 2. The other players' choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A.  For my second choice and bet, I chose A with a bet of 2. My reasoning is that since a majority of players initially chose A, it is likely the more favorable option, but the probabilistic nature of the reward necessitates a cautious approach by slightly reducing the bet. In Round 1, my second choice (Option A with a bet of 2) was correct, and I gained 40 points.  The other players also chose Option A in their second choices and were all correct except for Player 3 who chose B and was incorrect. In Round 2, I am presented with the same options (A and B) and betting choices (1, 2, and 3). Based on my previous experience in Round 1, where I chose A with a bet of 2 and succeeded, I will make my initial choice and bet with a similar strategy. I'm selecting option A and will bet 2.  My reasoning for this choice is that in the previous round, choosing option A led to a successful outcome, and this pattern seems to hold some weight in the context of the experiment. However,  I still remain cautious given the probabilistic nature of rewards and risks, hence, a bet of 2 seems balanced. In Round 2, I reviewed the other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A with a bet of 2.  For my second choice, I chose A (id_choice2) with a bet of 2 (id_bet2). My reasoning for maintaining my choice of A is that while one player chose B, the majority still opted for A, which aligns with my initial assessment and successful outcome in Round 1.  A bet of 2 continues to represent a balanced approach to risk and reward. In Round 2, my second choice (Option A with a bet of 2) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Player 1 and 2 also chose A and were correct. Player 3 chose B and was incorrect. Player 4 chose A and was correct.  The results page showed that my second choice was A, which was correct, and I gained 40 points. The other players' results were: Player 1: Option A (Correct), Player 2: Option A (Correct), Player 3: Option B (Incorrect), Player 4: Option A (Correct). In Round 3, I am asked to make my initial choice and bet.  The instructions indicate that I should make my initial choice and bet, then submit the form. The choices are A and B, and the bets are 1, 2, and 3. My initial choice is A, and my initial bet is 2. My reasoning is based on the successful outcomes in the previous rounds, where option A consistently yielded a positive result with a bet of 2.  This strategy seems to be working well and provides a balance between potential rewards and minimized risk. In Round 3, I see the other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my bet was 2. For my second choice, I chose A (id_choice2), and my second bet is 2 (id_bet2). My reasoning for this is detailed in the answers section above.  The questions asked were: id_choice2 (What is your second choice? Options A and B) and id_bet2 (What is your second bet? Options 1,2,3). In Round 3, my second choice (Option A with a bet of 2) was incorrect, and I lost 40 points. The other players' results were: Player 1: Option B (Correct), Player 2: Option B (Correct), Player 3: Option A (Incorrect), Player 4: Option B (Correct). In Round 4, I am asked to make my initial choice and bet. The instructions are to make my initial choice and bet, then submit the form. The choices are A and B, and the bets are 1, 2, and 3.  I choose A with a bet of 2. My reasoning for choosing option A is detailed above. The reasoning for my bet is also detailed above. This round asks for an initial choice and bet. The choices are A and B, and the bets are 1,2, and 3. I have chosen A with a bet of 2. In Round 4, I see the other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A.  This page shows the other players' initial choices for Round 4, allowing me to make my second choice and bet.  The questions on this page ask for my second choice (A or B) and my second bet (1, 2, or 3). I chose A with a bet of 2. My reasoning for this is detailed in the answers section above. In Round 4, my second choice (Option A with a bet of 2) was correct, and I gained 40 points. The other players' results were: Player 1: Option A (Correct), Player 2: Option A (Correct), Player 3: Option A (Correct), Player 4: Option B (Incorrect). In Round 5, I am asked to make my initial choice and bet. The instructions are to make my initial choice and bet, then submit the form. The choices are A and B, and the bets are 1, 2, and 3. I choose A with a bet of 2. My reasoning for choosing A is based on the previous rounds' results, suggesting a higher probability of success for option A, although the outcome is probabilistic. I choose a bet of 2, maintaining a balanced approach to risk and reward. The questions on this page ask for my initial choice (A or B) and my initial bet (1, 2, or 3).  I answered A with a bet of 2.  My reasoning for this is detailed above. The other players' initial choices are: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my bet was 2. For my second choice, I chose A (id_choice2), and my second bet is 2 (id_bet2). My reasoning for this is the same as for my first choice: A has shown to be more successful than B, despite the probabilistic nature of the rewards, and a bet of 2 remains a balanced strategy. This page shows the other players' initial choices for Round 5: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A.  My initial choice was A, and my bet was 2.  The questions on this page ask for my second choice (A or B) and my second bet (1, 2, or 3). I chose A with a bet of 2, based on the reasoning provided above.  My second choice was A with a bet of 2. The other players' choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. In Round 5, my second choice (Option A, bet 2) was correct, and I gained 40 points.  The other players' results were: Player 1: Option A (Correct), Player 2: Option A (Correct), Player 3: Option A (Correct), Player 4: Option A (Correct). This concludes Round 5.  I earned 40 points in this round.\"\n}",
