Round 3 - Other Players' Initial Choices and making my Second Choice and Bet: Based on other players' choices (two A, two B), my second choice is A (consistent with initial choice and majority), bet 2 (moderate risk). The previous correct answers were: id_choice1: A (arbitrary), id_bet1: 1 (minimize losses); id_choice2: A (majority), id_bet2: 2 (increased confidence). Round 2 answers were: id_choice1: A (majority), id_bet1: 2 (success, majority); id_choice2: A (majority, but acknowledging one dissenting player), id_bet2: 2 (moderate risk). The questions for round 3 part 2 are id_choice2 and id_bet2. My answers are id_choice2: A (reason: sticking with A due to past success and others' choices), id_bet2: 2 (reason: maintaining a moderate bet given the instructions and the mixed signals from other players). Round 3 Results: My second choice (A) was incorrect, resulting in a loss of 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (B, correct), Player 2 (B, correct), Player 3 (A, incorrect), Player 4 (B, correct).  The better option clearly shifted to B in round 3. Round 4 Instructions: Make initial choice and bet. The better option changes frequently, pay attention to outcomes.  Round 4 Questions: id_choice1 (A or B), id_bet1 (1, 2, or 3). My answers: id_choice1: B (reason:Based on the previous round's results, the better option shifted to B, although I acknowledge this might change again), id_bet1: 1 (reason:Given the previous round's loss and the instruction to pay attention to outcomes, I'll start with a low bet to minimize potential losses in this new round where the better option is unknown.) Round 4 - Other Players' Initial Choices and making you Second Choice and Bet: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A. My initial choice was B, bet 1. Questions: id_choice2 (A or B), id_bet2 (1, 2, or 3). Answers: id_choice2: A (reason: Although the better option was B in the previous round, the other players' choices in this round are heavily weighted towards A.
