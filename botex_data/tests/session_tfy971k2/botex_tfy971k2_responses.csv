tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,1,id_bet1,1,Starting with the lowest bet to minimize potential losses in the initial round
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,1,id_choice1,A,Arbitrary choice for the first round
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,1,id_bet2,2,"I saw that most of the other players chose option A, so I'm slightly more confident in that choice this round.  I'm increasing my bet to reflect this increased confidence, but not going all the way to 3 just in case."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,1,id_choice2,A,"Most of the other players chose A in the first round.  This suggests that A might be the better option, at least for now."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,2,id_bet1,2,"Round 1 showed that option A was correct. Although the better option changes, maintaining a higher bet reflects a reasonable level of confidence, especially since the majority of players in the last round chose A."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,2,id_choice1,A,"The majority of players chose A in the previous round, and my choice of A was correct. While the correct option changes, this suggests a higher likelihood of A being the correct option in this round."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,2,id_bet2,2,"Although the majority chose A in the previous round, the fact that the better option changes multiple times and that one player chose B in this round makes me less confident. I'll reduce my bet to 2 to reflect this."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,2,id_choice2,A,"While one player chose B, the majority still chose A, suggesting A is still more likely to be correct.  The instructions emphasize paying attention to outcomes and changing choices as needed."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,3,id_bet1,2,"Given the previous rounds, maintaining a moderate bet seems prudent.  While I've had success with A, the instructions stress that the advantageous option changes. A bet of 2 balances potential reward with risk mitigation."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,3,id_choice1,A,"Although the better option changes, A has been correct more often in previous rounds.  I'll stick with A for now but carefully observe the outcomes."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,3,id_bet2,2,Maintaining a moderate bet given the instructions and the mixed signals from other players
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,3,id_choice2,A,"Sticking with A, as it was successful in the initial choice and two other players chose it as well."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,4,id_bet1,1,"Given the previous round's loss and the instruction to pay attention to outcomes, I'll start with a low bet to minimize potential losses in this new round where the better option is unknown."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,4,id_choice1,B,"In the previous round, the better option shifted to B.  While it's risky to assume this will continue, I'll choose B based on the recent results."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,4,id_bet2,1,"Given the previous round's loss and the mixed signals from other players, I'll again start with a low bet to minimize potential losses.  The better option seems unpredictable."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,4,id_choice2,A,"Although the better option was B in the previous round, the other players' choices in this round are heavily weighted towards A.  I will follow the majority again, acknowledging the risk based on the previous round's results."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,5,id_bet1,1,"Given the unpredictable nature of the better option and my loss in the previous round, I will minimize risk by choosing the lowest bet to limit potential losses."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,5,id_choice1,B,"Although the better option shifted to A in the previous round, I will choose B to continue learning and diversifying my choices. The better option changes frequently, thus it is important to explore both options."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,5,id_bet2,1,"Given the previous round's loss and the mixed signals from other players, I'll again start with a low bet to minimize potential losses. The better option seems unpredictable."
tfy971k2,iudjbpbs,5,id_choice2,A,"Although my initial choice was B and the previous round's results favored B, the other players' choices in this round are heavily weighted towards A. I will follow the majority again, acknowledging the risk based on the previous round's results."
