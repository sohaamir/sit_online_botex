jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,1,id_comprehension_q1,minus 60 points,"A bet of 3 means a potential gain or loss of 60 points (3 * 20).  Since the option wasn't rewarded, it's a loss of 60 points."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,1,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,The instruction explicitly asks to select Option 3.
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,1,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,"The instructions clearly state that the final score, determining the bonus, is randomly selected from either the first or second choice and bet."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,1,id_comprehension_q4,"One option will give you a reward randomly, and the other will give you a loss randomly","While not explicitly stated, the random reward/loss nature of the choices implies that one option won't always reward or penalize. The most likely scenario is a random distribution of rewards and losses."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,1,id_choice1,A,I select option A arbitrarily for the first choice. There is no information to suggest one option is better than the other at this stage.
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,1,id_bet1,2,I choose a medium bet to balance risk and reward.  Starting with a conservative bet allows me to learn more about the patterns in the game before committing to higher stakes.
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,1,id_choice2,A,"Three out of four players chose A initially, suggesting that this option may have a higher likelihood of success, or at least is perceived to be. Therefore, I will maintain my choice of A to see if this strategy proves fruitful. "
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,1,id_bet2,2,"Given that three out of four players chose option A initially, and my initial choice was also A, I will maintain a similar bet level to gauge the effectiveness of this strategy.  A lower bet reduces risk, which is appropriate given that the previous comprehension check revealed that option A is not always correct and the reward probabilities are not fixed."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,2,id_choice1,A,Sticking with option A to see if the trend from the previous round continues
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,2,id_bet1,2,Maintaining a medium risk bet to observe the pattern and consistency of the game dynamics
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,2,id_choice2,A,"Three out of four players chose A initially.  Sticking with A to see if consistency leads to better results, given that my previous choice of A was correct."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,2,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a medium risk level bet to observe its effectiveness in this round, considering the mixed initial choices of other players."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,3,id_choice1,A,"Three out of four players chose A initially, and maintaining consistency with the previous round to observe the effectiveness of this strategy."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,3,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a medium risk level to observe its effectiveness in this round, consistent with my previous strategy."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,3,id_choice2,A,"Two out of four players chose A initially. While not a clear majority, I'll stick with A to maintain consistency and observe the outcome.  The lack of a strong majority suggests that it may be more worthwhile to maintain a consistent choice, rather than switch based on other player's choices."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,3,id_bet2,2,"I will maintain a medium risk level to observe its effectiveness, as in the previous rounds.  The pattern of choices among players seems less predictable than in prior rounds, so I'll stick with a strategy that has worked moderately well so far."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,4,id_choice1,A,I will continue with choice A to evaluate its consistency in performance.
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,4,id_bet1,2,I will maintain a medium risk level for this round as well.
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,4,id_choice2,A,"I am sticking with choice A to assess its effectiveness over multiple rounds. Consistency in choice allows for a clearer evaluation of the outcome, helping me understand if A is truly a better choice than B or merely a matter of chance."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,4,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a medium risk level seems to be a reasonable strategy.  Lowering the bet to 1 might be too cautious, while increasing it to 3 might be too risky given the previous round's outcome."
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,5,id_choice1,A,I'm sticking with choice A for now to assess its long-term effectiveness.  Consistent choices help determine if a pattern emerges.
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,5,id_bet1,2,Maintaining a medium risk level seems to be a reasonable strategy so far.  I will continue with a bet of 2 to see if the pattern of wins and losses remains consistent.
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,5,id_choice2,A,I'm sticking with choice A to assess its effectiveness.  Consistency in my choices will help me understand if A is generally more beneficial or not.
jpp97wuj,ppizerh8,5,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a medium risk level seems to be a good strategy so far, and I want to continue with that."
