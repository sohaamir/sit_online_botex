    "summary": "This is an experiment where I will make a series of choices between two options (A or B), one rewarding points and the other reducing my score. I'll be playing with four other players simultaneously, but there's no competition or cooperation; my goal is to maximize my points. My points will be converted into a bonus payment of up to 3 USD, in addition to my hourly compensation of 10 USD per hour for completing both parts of the experiment. Each round involves two choices and bets. The first choice and bet are made before seeing other players' choices. The second choice and bet are made after seeing other players' choices. The bet reflects confidence (1-3), and points awarded/lost are multiplied by 20 times the bet (e.g., bet '3' and win = 60 points; bet '3' and lose = -60 points). Feedback is given only on the second choice/bet, showing points gained/lost and other players' second choices and win/loss status, but not their point totals. A random selection is made from the first choice/bet or second choice/bet to determine points that contribute to my bonus payment; I should make both choices carefully, though. There are 5 rounds in total. A comprehension check followed. Question 1 asked how many points are earned/lost for a second choice with a bet of 3 and a loss, which is -60 points. Question 2 was a catch question, requiring selection of Option 3. Question 3 asked how bonus payment is calculated, and the answer is that it's randomly determined from either the first or second choice/bet. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of images giving reward/loss, and the answer I gave was incorrect. The correct answer is that within each block, one option will be more likely to give you points (but will sometimes give a loss) whilst the other is more likely to give you a loss (but will sometimes reward you). In other words, the reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. The next page indicates the start of the task, consisting of 5 rounds. I pressed the 'Next' button to begin the first round. The first page of the task required me to make an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1, 2, or 3). I chose A and bet 2. My reasoning was to start with a moderate bet to observe the game's dynamics before adjusting my betting strategy in subsequent rounds. I chose A arbitrarily as there was no prior information to guide my initial choice. The next page showed other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A and my initial bet was 2. I then made my second choice and bet. For my second choice, I chose A again, reasoning that the majority of players initially chose A and I wanted to observe the outcome of this choice. For my second bet, I chose 2, maintaining a moderate bet to continue observing the game dynamics. The questions were: 1) Choose your second choice (A or B); 2) Choose your second bet (1, 2, or 3). My answers were: A and 2 respectively. Round 1 results showed that my second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. All other players also chose A and were correct. I am now ready to proceed to the next round. The instructions reiterate the task overview: making choices between two options to maximize points which will be converted to a bonus payment.  It details the process of initial choice and bet (reflecting confidence level 1-3), the revelation of other players' choices, the second choice and bet opportunity, and the feedback mechanism showing points gained/lost for the second choice/bet, other players' choices and win/loss status (but not their points). It emphasizes the importance of both first and second choices/bets for bonus payment calculation (randomly selected from either).  The instructions confirm that feedback is only given for the second choice/bet to help learning but that both choices and bets contribute to the score.  There are 5 rounds in total.  A second comprehension check was presented with four multiple choice questions. Question 1 tested understanding of points earned/lost based on bet and outcome.  My answer was -60 points. Question 2 was a catch question, requiring the selection of Option 3. My answer was Option 3. Question 3 checked understanding of bonus payment calculation; my answer was that it's randomly determined from either the first or second choice/bet. Question 4 assessed understanding of reward/loss probabilities; my answer was that one option will be more likely to give a reward most of the time than the other."

Round 1: I chose A, bet 2; others: 3 A's, 1 B. Second choice: A, bet 2, won 40 points. Comprehension checks were passed. Round 2: Initial choice: A, bet 2. Other players' initial choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. My second choice was A, and my second bet was 2. Round 2 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (B, incorrect), Player 4 (A, correct).  In each round, I will first make a choice between option A or B and place a bet (1-3) reflecting my confidence in my choice.  Then, I will see the choices of the other four players. After this, I will make a second choice and bet, potentially changing my initial choice and bet. Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing the points gained or lost (bet * 20), and the second choices of the other players, but not their points. My bonus payment is randomly determined based on either my first or second choice/bet. There are a total of 5 rounds.  A comprehension check was presented with four questions. Question 1 asked about points earned/lost given a scenario; I answered '-60 points'. Question 2 was a catch question; I answered 'Option 3' as instructed. Question 3 asked about bonus payment calculation; I answered 'From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial'. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of rewards/losses; I answered 'Randomly determined'."

Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing the points gained or lost (bet * 20), and the second choices of the other players, but not their points. My bonus payment is randomly determined based on either my first or second choice/bet. There are a total of 5 rounds. A comprehension check was presented with four questions. Question 1 asked about points earned/lost given a scenario; I answered '-60 points'. Question 2 was a catch question; I answered 'Option 3' as instructed. Question 3 asked about bonus payment calculation; I answered 'From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial'. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of rewards/losses; I answered 'Randomly determined'. This answer was incorrect. The correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time.  The feedback clarified that within each block, one option is more likely to give points (but will sometimes give a loss), while the other is more likely to give a loss (but will sometimes reward). The reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. The next page indicates the start of the 5 rounds of the task. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to begin round 1. The current page presents the start of Round 3. I am asked to make an initial choice between A and B, and an initial bet between 1, 2, or 3. My answers are: id_choice1: A, reason: I will stick with option A, as it has yielded a better result in the previous rounds, but acknowledge the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses.; id_bet1: 2, reason: I will continue with a bet of 2 to maintain consistency and assess the probabilistic nature of the rewards across rounds.  The page shows other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  I chose A again for the second choice and bet 2 for my second bet. Round 3 Results: My second choice (A) was incorrect, and I lost 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (B, correct), Player 2 (B, correct), Player 3 (A, incorrect), Player 4 (B, correct). The instructions reiterate that the goal is to maximize points for a bonus payment.  Each round involves an initial choice (A or B) and bet (1-3), followed by a second choice and bet after seeing other players' choices.  The bonus payment is determined randomly from either the first or second choice/bet.  Feedback is provided only on the second choice, showing points gained/lost (bet*20) and other players' second choices, but not their points.  One option is more likely to yield rewards within each block, although the outcome remains probabilistic.  The comprehension check included four multiple choice questions. Question 1:  If a bet of 2 is changed to a bet of 3 for the second choice, and the option chosen was not rewarded, how many points are earned/lost? My answer: minus 60 points. Question 2 (catch question): Select Option 3. My answer: Option 3. Question 3: How is the bonus payment calculated? My answer: From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial. Question 4: How likely are rewards/losses in each block? My answer: One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time."

Round 2 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (B, incorrect), Player 4 (A, correct). Round 3: Other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2. My second choice is A, and my second bet is 2. In each round, I will first make a choice between option A or B and place a bet (1-3) reflecting my confidence in my choice. Then, I will see the choices of the other four players. After this, I will make a second choice and bet, potentially changing my initial choice and bet. Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing the points gained or lost (bet * 20), and the second choices of the other players, but not their points. My bonus payment is randomly determined based on either my first or second choice/bet. There are a total of 5 rounds. A comprehension check was presented with four questions. Question 1 asked about points earned/lost given a scenario; I answered '-60 points'. Question 2 was a catch question; I answered 'Option 3' as instructed. Question 3 asked about bonus payment calculation; I answered 'From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial'. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of rewards/losses; I answered 'Randomly determined'. This answer was incorrect. The correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time.  The feedback clarified that within each block, one option is more likely to give points (but will sometimes give a loss), while the other is more likely to give a loss (but will sometimes reward). The reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. The next page indicates the start of the 5 rounds of the task. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to begin round 1. The current page presents the start of Round 4. I am asked to make an initial choice between A and B, and an initial bet between 1, 2, or 3. My answers are: id_choice1: A, reason: I will stick with option A, as it has yielded a better result in the previous rounds, but acknowledge the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses.; id_bet1: 2, reason: I will continue with a bet of 2 to maintain consistency and assess the probabilistic nature of the rewards across rounds.  The page shows other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  I chose A again for the second choice and bet 2 for my second bet. Round 3 Results: My second choice (A) was incorrect, and I lost 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (B, correct), Player 2 (B, correct), Player 3 (A, incorrect), Player 4 (B, correct). The instructions reiterate that the goal is to maximize points for a bonus payment.  Each round involves an initial choice (A or B) and bet (1-3), followed by a second choice and bet after seeing other players' choices.  The bonus payment is determined randomly from either the first or second choice/bet.  Feedback is provided only on the second choice, showing points gained/lost (bet*20) and other players' second choices, but not their points.  One option is more likely to yield rewards within each block, although the outcome remains probabilistic.  The comprehension check included four multiple choice questions. Question 1:  If a bet of 2 is changed to a bet of 3 for the second choice, and the option chosen was not rewarded, how many points are earned/lost? My answer: minus 60 points. Question 2 (catch question): Select Option 3. My answer: Option 3. Question 3: How is the bonus payment calculated? My answer: From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial. Question 4: How likely are rewards/losses in each block? My answer: One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time. I passed the comprehension check. The answers and reasoning for each question are provided.  The next step is to press the 'Next' button to proceed to the next page of instructions. The next page indicates that the task will now begin and consists of 5 rounds. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to start round 1. The current page shows the start of Round 4, asking for an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1-3). I chose A and bet 2. My reasoning is based on maintaining consistency and assessing the probabilistic nature of rewards across rounds. Round 4: Other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  My second choice is A, and my second bet is 2. Round 4 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (A, correct), Player 4 (B, incorrect)."

Round 3: Other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2. My second choice is A, and my second bet is 2. In each round, I will first make a choice between option A or B and place a bet (1-3) reflecting my confidence in my choice. Then, I will see the choices of the other four players. After this, I will make a second choice and bet, potentially changing my initial choice and bet. Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing the points gained or lost (bet * 20), and the second choices of the other players, but not their points. My bonus payment is randomly determined based on either my first or second choice/bet. There are a total of 5 rounds. A comprehension check was presented with four questions. Question 1 asked about points earned/lost given a scenario; I answered '-60 points'. Question 2 was a catch question; I answered 'Option 3' as instructed. Question 3 asked about bonus payment calculation; I answered 'From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial'. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of rewards/losses; I answered 'Randomly determined'. This answer was incorrect. The correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time.  The feedback clarified that within each block, one option is more likely to give points (but will sometimes give a loss), while the other is more likely to give a loss (but will sometimes reward). The reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. The next page indicates the start of the 5 rounds of the task. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to begin round 1. The current page presents the start of Round 4. I am asked to make an initial choice between A and B, and an initial bet between 1, 2, or 3. My answers are: id_choice1: A, reason: I will stick with option A, as it has yielded a better result in the previous rounds, but acknowledge the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses.; id_bet1: 2, reason: I will continue with a bet of 2 to maintain consistency and assess the probabilistic nature of the rewards across rounds.  The page shows other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  I chose A again for the second choice and bet 2 for my second bet. Round 3 Results: My second choice (A) was incorrect, and I lost 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (B, correct), Player 2 (B, correct), Player 3 (A, incorrect), Player 4 (B, correct). The instructions reiterate that the goal is to maximize points for a bonus payment.  Each round involves an initial choice (A or B) and bet (1-3), followed by a second choice and bet after seeing other players' choices.  The bonus payment is determined randomly from either the first or second choice/bet.  Feedback is provided only on the second choice, showing points gained/lost (bet*20) and other players' second choices, but not their points.  One option is more likely to yield rewards within each block, although the outcome remains probabilistic.  The comprehension check included four multiple choice questions. Question 1:  If a bet of 2 is changed to a bet of 3 for the second choice, and the option chosen was not rewarded, how many points are earned/lost? My answer: minus 60 points. Question 2 (catch question): Select Option 3. My answer: Option 3. Question 3: How is the bonus payment calculated? My answer: From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial. Question 4: How likely are rewards/losses in each block? My answer: One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time. I passed the comprehension check. The answers and reasoning for each question are provided.  The next step is to press the 'Next' button to proceed to the next page of instructions. The next page indicates that the task will now begin and consists of 5 rounds. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to start round 1. The current page shows the start of Round 4, asking for an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1-3). I chose A and bet 2. My reasoning is based on maintaining consistency and assessing the probabilistic nature of rewards across rounds. Round 4: Other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  My second choice is A, and my second bet is 2. Round 4 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (A, correct), Player 4 (B, incorrect). The current page provides further details on the task.  The goal is to maximize points to earn a bonus payment.

I passed the comprehension check. The comprehension check questions and answers are reviewed. Question 1 correctly calculated points lost (-60). Question 2 was a catch question, correctly answered with Option 3. Question 3 correctly identified the random bonus payment selection from the first or second choice/bet. Question 4 correctly identified that one option is more likely to reward than the other within each block.  The next step is to press the 'Next' button to proceed to the next page of instructions. The next page states that the task will now begin, consisting of 5 rounds.  I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to proceed to round 1."

The next page indicates that the task will now begin and consists of 5 rounds. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to start round 1. The current page shows the start of Round 4, asking for an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1-3). I chose A and bet 2. My reasoning is based on maintaining consistency and assessing the probabilistic nature of rewards across rounds. Round 4: Other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  My second choice is A, and my second bet is 2. Round 4 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (A, correct), Player 4 (B, incorrect). The current page provides further details on the task.  The goal is to maximize points to earn a bonus payment.  Each round consists of an initial choice (A or B) and bet (1-3), followed by a second choice and bet after seeing other players' choices. The bonus is randomly determined from either the first or second choice/bet. Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing points (bet*20) and other players' choices, but not their points. One option is more likely to yield rewards, but the outcome is probabilistic.  This page contains a comprehension check with four multiple choice questions. Question 1 asks about points earned/lost given a scenario; my answer is '-60 points'. Question 2 is a catch question; my answer is 'Option 3'. Question 3 asks about bonus payment calculation; my answer is 'From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial'. Question 4 asks about the likelihood of rewards/losses; my answer is 'One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time'.  I passed the comprehension check. The comprehension check questions and answers are reviewed. Question 1 correctly calculated points lost (-60). Question 2 was a catch question, correctly answered with Option 3. Question 3 correctly identified the random bonus payment selection from the first or second choice/bet. Question 4 correctly identified that one option is more likely to reward than the other within each block.  The next step is to press the 'Next' button to proceed to the next page of instructions. The next page states that the task will now begin, consisting of 5 rounds.  I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to proceed to round 1.  The current page presents the start of Round 5.  It asks for an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1-3).  I will provide my answers. My initial choice is A, and my initial bet is 2. My reasonings for this choice and bet are consistent with my previous decisions. This page requests an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1-3).  Other Players' Initial Choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. My Initial Choice and Bet: A, 2.  Second Choice: A. Second Bet: 2.  Reasoning for the second choice is to continue with A based on past performance. Reasoning for maintaining bet 2 is consistency in strategy. Round 5 Results: My second choice was A, and it was correct. I gained 40 points. Other players also chose A and were correct.  The instructions indicate to click 'Next' to proceed."

    "summary": "This is an experiment where I make choices between two options (A or B) to maximize points, which will be converted into a bonus payment of up to 3 USD, in addition to my hourly compensation of 10 USD. There are 5 rounds with four other players, but no interaction is required. Each round involves two choices and bets (1-3). The bet multiplies points by 20. Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing points gained/lost and other players' choices but not their points. Bonus payment is randomly chosen from either the first or second choice/bet. Round 1: I chose A, bet 2; others: 3 A's, 1 B. Second choice: A, bet 2, won 40 points. Comprehension checks were passed. Round 2: Initial choice: A, bet 2. Other players' initial choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. My second choice was A, and my second bet was 2. Round 2 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (B, incorrect), Player 4 (A, correct). Round 3: Other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2. My second choice is A, and my second bet is 2. In each round, I will first make a choice between option A or B and place a bet (1-3) reflecting my confidence in my choice. Then, I will see the choices of the other four players. After this, I will make a second choice and bet, potentially changing my initial choice and bet. Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing the points gained or lost (bet * 20), and the second choices of the other players, but not their points. My bonus payment is randomly determined based on either my first or second choice/bet. There are a total of 5 rounds. A comprehension check was presented with four questions. Question 1 asked about points earned/lost given a scenario; I answered '-60 points'. Question 2 was a catch question; I answered 'Option 3' as instructed. Question 3 asked about bonus payment calculation; I answered 'From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial'. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of rewards/losses; I answered 'Randomly determined'. This answer was incorrect. The correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time.  The feedback clarified that within each block, one option is more likely to give points (but will sometimes give a loss), while the other is more likely to give a loss (but will sometimes reward). The reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. The next page indicates the start of the 5 rounds of the task. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to begin round 1. The current page presents the start of Round 4. I am asked to make an initial choice between A and B, and an initial bet between 1, 2, or 3. My answers are: id_choice1: A, reason: I will stick with option A, as it has yielded a better result in the previous rounds, but acknowledge the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses.; id_bet1: 2, reason: I will continue with a bet of 2 to maintain consistency and assess the probabilistic nature of the rewards across rounds.  The page shows other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  I chose A again for the second choice and bet 2 for my second bet. Round 3 Results: My second choice (A) was incorrect, and I lost 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (B, correct), Player 2 (B, correct), Player 3 (A, incorrect), Player 4 (B, correct). The instructions reiterate that the goal is to maximize points for a bonus payment.  Each round involves an initial choice (A or B) and bet (1-3), followed by a second choice and bet after seeing other players' choices.  The bonus payment is determined randomly from either the first or second choice/bet.  Feedback is provided only on the second choice, showing points gained/lost (bet*20) and other players' second choices, but not their points.  One option is more likely to yield rewards within each block, although the outcome remains probabilistic.  The comprehension check included four multiple choice questions. Question 1:  If a bet of 2 is changed to a bet of 3 for the second choice, and the option chosen was not rewarded, how many points are earned/lost? My answer: minus 60 points. Question 2 (catch question): Select Option 3. My answer: Option 3. Question 3: How is the bonus payment calculated? My answer: From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial. Question 4: How likely are rewards/losses in each block? My answer: One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time. I passed the comprehension check. The answers and reasoning for each question are provided.  The next step is to press the 'Next' button to proceed to the next page of instructions.

{
    "confused": false,
    "remarks": "The experiment was well-structured and the instructions were clear.  The JSON format for responses worked well, though handling the cumulative summary across rounds was somewhat challenging. The probabilistic reward structure was initially confusing, but the feedback was helpful in clarifying the mechanism.  Overall, I found the experiment engaging, and the use of JSON ensured clear and structured data capture.  My only suggestion might be to consider providing an example of the expected JSON format in the initial instructions, as this might reduce the initial cognitive load for the participants."
