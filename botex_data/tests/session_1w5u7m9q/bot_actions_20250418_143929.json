I chose A arbitrarily as there was no prior information to guide my initial choice. The next page showed other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A and my initial bet was 2. I then made my second choice and bet. For my second choice, I chose A again, reasoning that the majority of players initially chose A and I wanted to observe the outcome of this choice. For my second bet, I chose 2, maintaining a moderate bet to continue observing the game dynamics. The questions were: 1) Choose your second choice (A or B); 2) Choose your second bet (1, 2, or 3). My answers were: A and 2 respectively. Round 1 results showed that my second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. All other players also chose A and were correct. I am now ready to proceed to the next round. The instructions reiterate the task overview: making choices between two options to maximize points which will be converted to a bonus payment. It details the process of initial choice and bet (reflecting confidence level 1-3), the revelation of other players' choices, the second choice and bet opportunity, and the feedback mechanism showing points gained/lost for the second choice/bet, other players' choices and win/loss status (but not their points). It emphasizes the importance of both first and second choices/bets for bonus payment calculation (randomly selected from either). The instructions confirm that feedback is only given for the second choice/bet to help learning but that both choices and bets contribute to the score. There are 5 rounds in total. A second comprehension check was presented with four multiple choice questions. Question 1 tested understanding of points earned/lost based on bet and outcome. My answer was -60 points. Question 2 was a catch question, requiring the selection of Option 3. My answer was Option 3. Question 3 checked understanding of bonus payment calculation; my answer was that it's randomly determined from either the first or second choice/bet. Question 4 assessed understanding of reward/loss probabilities; my answer was that one option will be more likely to give a reward most of the time than the other.  I have passed the comprehension check. The answers and reasoning for each question in the comprehension check are provided, confirming my understanding of the experiment's mechanics.

There are 5 rounds with four other players, but no interaction is required. Each round involves two choices and bets (1-3). The bet multiplies points by 20. Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing points gained/lost and other players' choices but not their points. Bonus payment is randomly chosen from either the first or second choice/bet. Round 1: I chose A, bet 2; others: 3 A's, 1 B. Second choice: A, bet 2, won 40 points. Comprehension checks were passed. Round 2: Initial choice: A, bet 2. Other players' initial choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. My second choice was A, and my second bet was 2. Round 2 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (B, incorrect), Player 4 (A, correct). Round 3: Other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2. My second choice is A, and my second bet is 2.

After this, I will make a second choice and bet, potentially changing my initial choice and bet. Feedback is given only on the second choice, showing the points gained or lost (bet * 20), and the second choices of the other players, but not their points. My bonus payment is randomly determined based on either my first or second choice/bet. There are a total of 5 rounds. A comprehension check was presented with four questions. Question 1 asked about points earned/lost given a scenario; I answered '-60 points'. Question 2 was a catch question; I answered 'Option 3' as instructed. Question 3 asked about bonus payment calculation; I answered 'From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial'. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of rewards/losses; I answered 'Randomly determined'. This answer was incorrect. The correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time.  The feedback clarified that within each block, one option is more likely to give points (but will sometimes give a loss), while the other is more likely to give a loss (but will sometimes reward). The reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. The next page indicates the start of the 5 rounds of the task. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to begin round 1. The current page presents the start of Round 4. I am asked to make an initial choice between A and B, and an initial bet between 1, 2, or 3. My answers are: id_choice1: A, reason: I will stick with option A, as it has yielded a better result in the previous rounds, but acknowledge the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses.; id_bet1: 2, reason: I will continue with a bet of 2 to maintain consistency and assess the probabilistic nature of the rewards across rounds.  The page shows other players' initial choices: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  I chose A again for the second choice and bet 2 for my second bet. Round 3 Results: My second choice (A) was incorrect, and I lost 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (B, correct), Player 2 (B, correct), Player 3 (A, incorrect), Player 4 (B, correct).

The bonus payment is determined randomly from either the first or second choice/bet.  Feedback is provided only on the second choice, showing points gained/lost (bet*20) and other players' second choices, but not their points.  One option is more likely to yield rewards within each block, although the outcome remains probabilistic.  The comprehension check included four multiple choice questions. Question 1:  If a bet of 2 is changed to a bet of 3 for the second choice, and the option chosen was not rewarded, how many points are earned/lost? My answer: minus 60 points. Question 2 (catch question): Select Option 3. My answer: Option 3. Question 3: How is the bonus payment calculated? My answer: From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial. Question 4: How likely are rewards/losses in each block? My answer: One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time. I passed the comprehension check.

Other players' results: Player 1 (B, correct), Player 2 (B, correct), Player 3 (A, incorrect), Player 4 (B, correct). The instructions reiterate that the goal is to maximize points for a bonus payment.  Each round involves an initial choice (A or B) and bet (1-3), followed by a second choice and bet after seeing other players' choices.  The bonus payment is determined randomly from either the first or second choice/bet.  Feedback is provided only on the second choice, showing points gained/lost (bet*20) and other players' second choices, but not their points.  One option is more likely to yield rewards within each block, although the outcome remains probabilistic.  The comprehension check included four multiple choice questions. Question 1:  If a bet of 2 is changed to a bet of 3 for the second choice, and the option chosen was not rewarded, how many points are earned/lost? My answer: minus 60 points. Question 2 (catch question): Select Option 3. My answer: Option 3. Question 3: How is the bonus payment calculated? My answer: From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial. Question 4: How likely are rewards/losses in each block? My answer: One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time. I passed the comprehension check. The answers and reasoning for each question are provided.  The next step is to press the 'Next' button to proceed to the next page of instructions. The next page indicates that the task will now begin and consists of 5 rounds. I am instructed to press the 'Next' button to start round 1. The current page shows the start of Round 4, asking for an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1-3). I chose A and bet 2. My reasoning is based on maintaining consistency and assessing the probabilistic nature of rewards across rounds. Round 4: Other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  My second choice is A, and my second bet is 2. Round 4 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (A, correct), Player 4 (B, incorrect).
