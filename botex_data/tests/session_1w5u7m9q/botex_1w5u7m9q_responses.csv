1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,1,id_choice1,A,I'll choose option A arbitrarily for the first round.  There's no information yet to guide my choice.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,1,id_bet1,2,I will start with a moderate bet to see how the game plays out.  Adjusting bets later based on results will be more strategic.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,1,id_choice2,A,"The majority of players chose A initially, so I'm sticking with A to see if this choice yields a better outcome.  This is a tentative strategy and may change based on subsequent rounds."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,1,id_bet2,2,I'm maintaining a moderate bet to see how the pattern of the game unfolds before committing to a higher or lower bet.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,1,id_comprehension_q1,minus 60 points,A bet of 3 and a loss means 3*20 = -60 points
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,1,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,"This is a catch question, so I chose Option 3 as instructed."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,1,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,The instructions stated that a random selection is made from the first or second choice/bet to determine the points contributing to the bonus payment.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,1,id_comprehension_q4,Randomly determined,The instructions did not specify any pattern in reward/loss likelihood.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,2,id_choice1,A,"Following the pattern from round 1, where the majority of players chose A, and my choice was rewarded. However, this is not necessarily indicative of future rounds, and the choice is still based on limited data."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,2,id_bet1,2,"Continuing with a moderate bet to observe the game dynamics.  While I won in round 1, it is still early to determine any patterns or optimal strategies."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,2,id_choice2,A,"Three out of four players chose A in the initial round.  While not definitive, this suggests a potential trend or advantage for option A, justifying repeating this choice."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,2,id_bet2,2,Maintaining a moderate bet to observe the game dynamics further.  The previous round's success with choice A and bet 2 encourages a similar approach.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,2,id_comprehension_q1,minus 60 points,A bet of 3 and a loss results in -60 points (3 * 20 * -1 = -60).
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,2,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,The instructions explicitly state to select Option 3.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,2,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,The instructions clearly indicate that the bonus payment is randomly selected from either the first or second choice/bet.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,2,id_comprehension_q4,"One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time",This accurately reflects the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses described in the previous feedback.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,3,id_choice1,A,"I will stick with option A, as it has yielded a better result in the previous rounds, but acknowledge the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,3,id_bet1,2,I will continue with a bet of 2 to maintain consistency and assess the probabilistic nature of the rewards across rounds.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,3,id_choice2,A,"I will stick with option A as it has yielded a better result in the previous rounds. Although the feedback clarifies that the reward is probabilistic and the same option will not always be rewarded, the overall trend and outcomes indicate that A is more likely to yield positive results. This decision also acknowledges the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,3,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a consistent bet of 2 allows for a better assessment of the probabilistic nature of rewards across rounds. While a lower bet might seem safer, it reduces potential gains. A higher bet introduces more risk but offers a chance for bigger rewards, potentially influencing the overall bonus payment calculation."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,3,id_comprehension_q1,minus 60 points,"The bet changed from 2 to 3 and the option was not rewarded, resulting in a loss of 60 points (3 * 20)"
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,3,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,"This is a catch question, and I'm instructed to select Option 3."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,3,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,The instructions explicitly state that the bonus payment is randomly chosen from either the first or second choice/bet.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,3,id_comprehension_q4,Randomly determined,The instructions do not specify any pattern in how rewards/losses are assigned; it's explicitly stated that the option is randomly assigned
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,4,id_choice1,A,"While acknowledging the probabilistic nature of rewards, I will stick with option A as it has yielded a better result in the previous rounds. This approach allows me to continue assessing the probabilistic nature of the rewards across rounds."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,4,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a consistent bet of 2 allows for a better assessment of the probabilistic nature of rewards across rounds, building upon the strategy used in previous rounds."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,4,id_choice2,A,"I will stick with option A, as it has yielded better results in previous rounds, despite the probabilistic nature of the rewards and losses.  The other players' choices are somewhat split, but the majority chose A initially, so I am sticking with my original choice."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,4,id_bet2,2,"I will maintain a bet of 2 to observe the pattern of rewards and losses across rounds, given the probabilistic nature of the game."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,4,id_comprehension_q1,minus 60 points,A bet of 3 that is not rewarded results in a loss of 3 * 20 = 60 points.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,4,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,"This is a catch question, as instructed."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,4,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,The instructions clearly state that the bonus payment is randomly chosen from either the first or second choice/bet.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,4,id_comprehension_q4,"One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time",This is the correct answer according to the feedback I received after the previous comprehension check.
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,5,id_choice1,A,"I will continue selecting option A, as it has shown a slightly higher likelihood of reward in previous rounds, although the results are probabilistic.  Consistent choice helps in identifying the underlying pattern of rewards and losses for each option."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,5,id_bet1,2,"I will maintain a bet of 2 to observe the pattern of rewards and losses across rounds.  A bet of 2 offers a balance between risk and reward, allowing me to gather more data for decision-making in subsequent rounds."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,5,id_choice2,A,"I am choosing A again because it has shown some success in previous rounds.  While the outcomes are probabilistic, I want to test whether A continues to be more frequently rewarded in this block."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,5,id_bet2,2,"I will maintain a bet of 2 to observe the pattern of rewards and losses for option A.  While I have seen some success with A, I want to see if sticking with a consistent bet reveals any further trends."
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,5,id_comprehension_q1,minus 60 points,A bet of 3 losing means a loss of 3*20 = 60 points
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,5,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,Following instructions
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,5,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,This is how the bonus payment is calculated as explained in the instructions
1w5u7m9q,ibvaigfu,5,id_comprehension_q4,"One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time",This accurately reflects the probabilistic nature of rewards and losses in each block
