naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,1,id_choice1,A,I will choose option A arbitrarily for the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on the feedback.
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,1,id_bet1,2,I will start with a moderate bet to gauge the probabilities.
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,1,id_choice2,A,"Following the majority choice of other players, which indicates it may be the more likely option to yield positive results."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,1,id_bet2,2,Maintaining a moderate bet to observe the pattern.  Slightly reducing bet from previous round to account for the uncertainty.
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,1,id_comprehension_q1,minus 40 points,"The question states that the option chosen was not rewarded, and the second bet was 3. Therefore, the points lost are 3*20 = 60 points"
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,1,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,"The question asks to select Option 3, so I select Option 3"
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,1,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,This is explicitly stated in the initial instructions
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,1,id_comprehension_q4,Randomly determined,The instructions do not specify any bias in rewards
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,2,id_choice1,A,"Option A has shown to be more successful in the previous round, with a majority of players choosing it and receiving positive points. I will continue choosing option A for now, though this could change based on future rounds."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,2,id_bet1,2,Maintaining a moderate bet to continue gauging the probabilities.  I will adjust my bet based on the results of this round and subsequent rounds.
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,2,id_choice2,A,"Three out of four players chose A initially. Although this is not definitive proof of which option is better, it suggests a trend and makes A a more likely choice."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,2,id_bet2,2,Maintaining a moderate bet to observe the pattern.  A bet of 2 allows for a decent potential gain while limiting potential losses.
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,3,id_choice1,A,"Option A has shown consistent success in the previous rounds, indicating a higher probability of reward.  I will continue to choose A unless a clear pattern emerges favoring B."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,3,id_bet1,2,Continuing with a moderate bet to observe the pattern and avoid significant losses or gains too early in the experiment.
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,3,id_choice2,A,"Although other players' initial choices are split between A and B, my previous success with option A in rounds 1 and 2 suggests a higher probability of reward.  I will continue with A, though I should acknowledge that the probabilities could be shifting."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,3,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a moderate bet to balance risk and reward, given the uncertainty of the probabilities after observing other players' choices in round 3."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,4,id_choice1,A,"Continuing with option A. Although it led to a loss in Round 3, the overall performance of option A across the first three rounds is better than B. I am still testing the waters, and a consistent approach might uncover patterns."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,4,id_bet1,2,"Sticking with bet 2, as it has yielded consistent results (though not always positive) in previous rounds.  A smaller bet minimizes potential losses during this exploratory phase."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,4,id_choice2,A,"Option A has shown some success in previous rounds, and I see no compelling reason to switch at this point."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,4,id_bet2,2,Maintaining a bet of 2 has yielded a balance of risk and reward in previous rounds.  Sticking with this strategy seems prudent.
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,5,id_choice1,A,"Option A has shown more success than option B in previous rounds, despite some losses.  Continuing with option A allows for the continued assessment of its overall effectiveness."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,5,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a consistent bet of 2 has yielded a balance between risk and reward in previous rounds.  While a bet of 1 minimizes potential losses, a bet of 3 increases risk, and 2 has proven relatively successful so far."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,5,id_choice2,A,"Option A has shown some success in previous rounds.  While there is variation in outcomes, it remains a reasonable choice, especially given my previous successes with it.  The other players' choices do not dramatically alter my strategy."
naadp1mw,9xhpx7ll,5,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 has yielded a balance of risk and reward in previous rounds.  While I am open to adjusting this in future rounds if necessary, it seems prudent to maintain consistency for this round."
