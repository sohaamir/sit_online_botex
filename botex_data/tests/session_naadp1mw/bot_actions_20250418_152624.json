After making an initial choice and bet, I will see other players' choices before making a second choice and bet. My bonus payment is partly determined by both choices and bets. Feedback is given only for the second choice, showing points gained or lost (bet multiplied by 20 if won, subtracted if lost). The total score is calculated randomly from either my first or second choice/bet. There are 5 rounds in total. I will see the second choices of other players and whether they won or lost, but not their points. I have completed a comprehension check. My answer to question 1 ('-60 points' for a first bet of 2, changing to a second bet of 3, not changing my option and losing) was correct. My answer to question 2 (selecting Option 3) was correct. My answer to question 3 ('bonus payment calculated from either the first and second choices/bets, but randomly on each trial') was correct. My answer to question 4 ('randomly determined' likelihood of images giving reward/loss) was incorrect; the correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time. The comprehension check revealed that within each block, one option will be more likely to give points (but will sometimes give a loss), while the other is more likely to give a loss (but will sometimes reward). The reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. I have now transitioned to the task, which consists of 5 rounds. I am ready to proceed to the first round and make my first choice and bet. In round 1, I chose option A and bet 2. My reasoning is to start with a moderate bet to gauge the probabilities and to choose an option arbitrarily for the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on the feedback. In round 1, other players' initial choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A.  My initial choice was A and my initial bet was 2. For my second choice, I chose A (because the majority chose A initially, suggesting it may be the better option) and my second bet was 2 (maintaining a moderate bet strategy). In round 1, my second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points.  Other players also chose A for their second choice and were correct except for Player 3 who chose B and was incorrect. I am now proceeding to round 2. The instructions for round 2 state that I need to make my initial choice and bet.  I chose option A again and bet 2. My reasoning for choosing option A is based on its previous success. My reasoning for betting 2 is to maintain a moderate approach and assess the probabilities. In round 2, the other players' initial choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A.  I will now make my second choice and bet.  The question was: Select your second choice: A or B. I chose A because three out of four players selected A initially. The question was: Select your second bet: 1, 2, or 3. I chose 2 because it's a moderate bet allowing for reasonable gain and loss management. In round 2, my second choice was A and it was correct. I gained 40 points. Player 1, 2 and 4 also chose A and were correct. Player 3 chose B and was incorrect. I am now ready to proceed to round 3. In round 3, I was asked to make an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1, 2, or 3). I chose A and bet 2. My reasoning for choosing option A is its consistent success in previous rounds, suggesting a higher likelihood of reward. My reasoning for betting 2 is to maintain a moderate approach, balancing potential gains and losses. \"\n}",

I'm playing with four others; there's no competition or cooperation. My base pay is 10 USD/hour plus a performance-based bonus up to 3 USD. Each round has two choices and bets (1, 2, or 3). Feedback is given after the second choice (bet * 20 if won, subtracted if lost). My total score is randomly determined from either my first or second choice/bet. There are 5 rounds. I see other players' second choices and outcomes, but not their points. I completed a comprehension check, correctly answering questions 1, 2, and 3, but not 4 (the correct answer is that one option is more likely to give a reward within each block). I've completed five rounds. Round 1: I chose A (bet 2), others' initial choices: Player 1: A, 2: A, 3: B, 4: A. My second choice was A (bet 2), and I gained 40 points. Round 2: I chose A (bet 2), others' initial choices: Player 1: A, 2: B, 3: A, 4: A. My second choice was A (bet 2), and I gained 40 points. Round 3: I chose A (bet 2). Other players' initial choices were: Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B. For my second choice, I chose A (bet 2). In Round 3, I chose A (bet 2) based on consistent success, aiming for a balance between potential gain and loss. In Round 3, I lost 40 points because my second choice (A) was incorrect. The other players' results were: Player 1: Option B (correct), Player 2: Option B (correct), Player 3: Option A (incorrect), Player 4: Option B (correct). Round 4: I chose option A with a bet of 2. My reasoning was to maintain consistency with my previous choices, as option A has shown some success in earlier rounds, and bet 2 provides a balance between risk and reward. The other players' initial choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A. I chose option A with a bet of 2 for my second choice. My reasoning was to maintain consistency, as option A has shown some success and a bet of 2 provides a balance between risk and reward.  My second choice in round 4 (option A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. The other players' results were: Player 1: Option A (correct), Player 2: Option A (correct), Player 3: Option A (correct), Player 4: Option B (incorrect). Round 5: I am presented with a new page that asks me to make my initial choice (A or B) and bet (1, 2, or 3). Based on previous rounds, I chose A (consistent with previous choices that yielded a balance of success and failure) and a bet of 2 (maintaining a balance between risk and reward). My reasoning for choosing A is that it has shown some success, while maintaining a consistent bet of 2 has provided a good balance in risk and potential reward.  The other players' initial choices for Round 5 are: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. For my second choice in round 5, I chose A and bet 2.  My reasoning is detailed above. The questions asked were: 1. Second Choice (A or B), 2. Second Bet (1,2, or 3). My answers were A and 2 respectively.  Round 5 Results: My second choice was A, which was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1: A (correct), Player 2: A (correct), Player 3: A (correct), Player 4: A (correct). The experiment is now completed. My final score is 120 points, which converts to a bonus payment of $0.20 USD. \"\n}",
