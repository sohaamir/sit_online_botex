1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,1,id_comprehension_q1,minus 60 points,"A bet of 3 means 60 points if I win, -60 if I lose. Since the option was not rewarded, I lose 60 points."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,1,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,The instruction explicitly asks to select Option 3.
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,1,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,The instructions clearly state that my score is randomly chosen from either my first or second choice and bet.
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,1,id_comprehension_q4,"One option will give you a reward randomly, and the other will give you a loss randomly","The instructions do not specify any particular pattern, suggesting a random reward/loss assignment for each option."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,1,id_choice1,A,"I select Option A arbitrarily for the first round, intending to observe the outcomes of the first round before making a more informed choice in subsequent rounds."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,1,id_bet1,2,"I choose a bet of 2 to start, balancing risk and potential reward.  I will adjust my betting strategy based on the outcomes of future rounds and the choices of other players."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,1,id_choice2,A,"The majority of other players chose Option A in the first round.  Following the majority might increase my chances of success, although it's important to remember that the outcomes are probabilistic."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,1,id_bet2,2,Maintaining a moderate bet allows me to observe the outcomes and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds.  A higher bet would risk losing more points if my prediction is incorrect.
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,2,id_choice1,A,"Following the majority of players' choices from round 1, as it had a successful outcome."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,2,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a consistent betting strategy from the previous round, while also considering the risk and potential reward."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,2,id_choice2,A,Three out of four players chose Option A in their initial choice. This suggests that Option A might be more likely to yield a positive outcome. I'll follow the majority for this round.
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,2,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a consistent betting strategy from the previous round, where a bet of 2 yielded a positive result.  I will adjust my bet based on the outcomes of future rounds."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,3,id_choice1,A,"I will continue to choose Option A, as it has yielded positive results in the previous two rounds.  While the instructions indicate an element of chance, consistently choosing the previously successful option appears to be a reasonable strategy."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,3,id_bet1,2,"I will maintain a bet of 2 to observe if the pattern of my gains continues.  Varying the bet might introduce unnecessary variability in the data, obscuring any underlying trends."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,3,id_choice2,A,"I will continue choosing option A, as it has been successful in the previous two rounds. Although the other players' initial choices are more split, my own consistent positive reinforcement outweighs this factor."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,3,id_bet2,2,I will maintain a bet of 2 to be consistent with my previous rounds and to limit risk while still having a chance for reasonable reward.
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,4,id_choice1,A,"Option A has consistently yielded positive results in the previous rounds.  Although round 3 resulted in a loss, the pattern of success with A outweighs the single instance of failure.  The information on the other players' choices will be considered in the second choice."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,4,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a consistent bet of 2 has yielded positive results in previous rounds, minimizing risk while offering a potential for reward.  While a bet of 1 minimizes risk further, the potential rewards are significantly reduced. A bet of 3 maximizes potential rewards but increases the risk of greater losses."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,4,id_choice2,A,Consistent with previous successful choices.  The majority of other players also chose A initially.
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,4,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining consistency with previous rounds, which yielded positive results when using a bet of 2.  Minimizing risk while still having potential for reward."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,5,id_choice1,A,Option A has consistently shown a higher probability of success in previous rounds.  Sticking with this choice seems to be the most logical approach to maximize my points.
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,5,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a consistent bet of 2 has yielded positive results in previous rounds. While there's inherent risk, this strategy minimizes potential losses and offers a reasonable chance of reward."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,5,id_choice2,A,"Consistent with previous successful choices.  Although round 3 showed a loss with this choice, maintaining consistency provides a better chance of earning in the long run."
1y4qy73a,y7vvgss5,5,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining consistency with previous rounds, and minimizing risk while still having a chance to earn points."
