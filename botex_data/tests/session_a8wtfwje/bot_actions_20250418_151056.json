Question 1 asked how many points I would earn/lose if I made a first bet of 2, changed it to 3, didn't change my option, and learned the option wasn't rewarded. I answered '-40 points', but the correct answer is '-60 points' because the loss of 20 points is multiplied by the second bet (3).

Question 3 asked how my bonus is calculated; I answered correctly that it's randomly determined from either the first or second choices/bets. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of rewards/losses; I answered incorrectly. The correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time, although the reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block.

The results for round 4 show that my second choice (A) was incorrect, resulting in a loss of 40 points. Other players' results were mixed; Player 1 and 2 chose Option B correctly, Player 3 chose A incorrectly, and Player 4 chose B correctly. I completed a comprehension check with four questions, getting two correct and two incorrect. The correct answers highlight that both my initial and revised choices/bets affect my score. The experiment involves 5 rounds in total.  Round 5: This round requires an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1, 2, or 3).  My choice is A, and my bet is 2, based on the reasoning that although option A hasn't consistently paid off, it seems to have higher potential returns.  The bet of 2 strikes a balance between risk and potential reward given the unpredictable nature of the experiment.  The page contained two questions: the first asked for my initial choice between A and B and the second asked for my initial bet (1, 2, or 3).  The next page showed other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A.  My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  I then made my second choice and bet.  The questions were: Select your second choice (A or B) and Select your second bet (1, 2, or 3). My second choice was A and my second bet was 2. Round 5 Results: My second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (A, correct), Player 2 (A, correct), Player 3 (A, correct), Player 4 (B, incorrect). Round 6: The instructions for this round indicated that I should make my initial choice and bet. The questions were: Select your choice (A or B) and Select your bet (1, 2, or 3). My choice was A and my bet was 2. Round 7: This round presented other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2. The questions asked for my second choice and bet.  My second choice was A and my second bet was 2.  The reasoning behind this choice and bet is the same as in previous rounds: while option A's consistency is questionable, it has a higher reward potential, and a bet of 2 keeps the balance between risk and reward.\"\n}",
