a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,1,id_choice1,A,I'll choose option A arbitrarily for the first round.
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,1,id_bet1,2,I will start with a moderate bet to see the outcome and adjust accordingly in the next round
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,1,id_choice2,A,"I will stick with my initial choice of 'A' because most of the other players also selected 'A' initially, suggesting this option might be more rewarding."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,1,id_bet2,2,"I maintain my bet of 2 to reflect my confidence level, which hasn't changed after seeing other players' choices."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,1,id_comprehension_q1,minus 40 points,"The question states that the bet was 3 and the option was not rewarded.  Therefore, the points lost would be 3 * -20 = -60 points. However, this is not one of the options, the closest answer is -40 points"
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,1,id_comprehension_q2,Option 3,The instructions explicitly asked to select Option 3
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,1,id_comprehension_q3,From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial,This is stated in the initial summary provided.
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,1,id_comprehension_q4,Randomly determined,The initial instructions do not specify any pattern to reward/loss
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,2,id_choice1,A,"Option A has shown success in the previous round, with the majority of participants selecting it and receiving a reward.  I will continue to choose option A in this round."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,2,id_bet1,2,"In the previous round, choosing A with a bet of 2 resulted in a correct choice and a gain of 40 points.  I will maintain a bet of 2 to reflect my continued confidence in option A, but also try to reduce my risk and increase profitability."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,2,id_choice2,A,"Although one player chose B initially, three out of four players selected A, indicating a higher probability of a reward for option A. I will continue to choose A in this round to maintain consistency and maximize my points."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,2,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 reflects my confidence level in option A, based on the previous round's success.  While three players chose A initially, one chose B, suggesting some uncertainty. A bet of 2 represents a moderate level of confidence, balancing potential reward with risk mitigation."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,3,id_choice1,A,"Option A has yielded positive results in the previous two rounds, and a majority of players chose it initially in both rounds."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,3,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 reflects my continued confidence in option A, based on the positive results from the previous two rounds."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,3,id_choice2,A,"In the first three rounds, choosing A yielded positive results. While the other players' choices are mixed in this round, I'll stick with A based on past performance."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,3,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 reflects my confidence level in option A, based on the positive outcomes in the previous rounds."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,4,id_choice1,A,"While not consistently rewarded, option A has shown higher potential payouts in earlier rounds.  The uncertainty suggests it's worth continuing with the same choice to gather further data.  There is some chance the data is telling me something and a new choice introduces noise to this analysis."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,4,id_bet1,2,"In previous rounds, betting 2 yielded mixed results.  A bet of 1 might be too cautious, while 3 is too risky given the unpredictable nature of the experiment.  2 provides a balance between potential reward and risk."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,4,id_choice2,A,"I am sticking with option A.  Although it resulted in a loss in the previous round, it has shown potential for higher gains in earlier rounds.  The other players' initial choices are mixed, and there is not enough evidence to suggest switching to B."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,4,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 balances risk and reward, given the unpredictable nature of the game.  A lower bet limits potential losses after the incorrect prediction in round 4, while a higher bet could yield higher gains if option A unexpectedly proves correct again.  A change to a lower or higher bet is not justified by the information available."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,5,id_choice1,A,"Although option A hasn't consistently yielded positive results, it has shown a higher potential for reward in previous rounds.  While the pattern is unpredictable, continuing to choose A allows for the potential to capture larger gains, even with the risk of losses."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,5,id_bet1,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 balances risk and reward, given the unpredictable pattern of returns observed so far.  A higher bet increases potential gains but also magnifies losses; a lower bet limits losses but reduces potential gains. A bet of 2 seems to provide a reasonable compromise in this situation."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,5,id_choice2,A,"I am sticking with option A.  Although the results have been inconsistent, option A has resulted in higher points gains in several rounds. While not consistently rewarded, option A seems to offer higher potential returns than B."
a8wtfwje,2h4fvfa9,5,id_bet2,2,"Maintaining a bet of 2 balances risk and reward, given the unpredictable nature of the experiment.  While option A hasn't been consistently rewarded, it has shown higher potential returns in some rounds. A bet of 2 allows for a reasonable potential gain without risking too much if the choice is incorrect."
