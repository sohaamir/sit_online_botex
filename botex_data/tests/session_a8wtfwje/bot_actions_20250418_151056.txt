            "answer": "A",
            "reason": "Although one player chose B initially, three out of four players selected A, indicating a higher probability of a reward for option A. I will continue to choose A in this round to maintain consistency and maximize my points."

    "summary": "This is an experiment where I will make a series of choices between two options, one rewarding points and the other reducing my score. I'll be playing with four other participants in real-time, but there's no cooperation or competition; my goal is to maximize my points. My points will be converted into a bonus payment, with higher scores resulting in higher payments. I'll receive $10 USD per hour for completing both parts of the experiment, plus a performance-based bonus of up to $3 USD. In each round, I will first make a choice and bet (1-3) on how confident I am in that choice. Then I will see the other participants' choices and can revise my choice and bet. My bonus payment is partly determined by both my first and second choices and bets. I will receive feedback on my second choice/bet only, showing points gained or lost (bet multiplied by 20). The feedback doesn't show my overall points total; it is for learning which option is rewarded. The total points are randomly calculated from either my first or second choice/bet. I will see if others changed choices but not their scores. There are 5 rounds in total. I then completed a comprehension check with four questions. Question 1 asked how many points I would earn/lose if I made a first bet of 2, changed it to 3, didn't change my option, and learned the option wasn't rewarded. I answered '-40 points', but the correct answer is '-60 points' because the loss of 20 points is multiplied by the second bet (3). Question 2 was a catch question, instructing me to select Option 3, which I did correctly. Question 3 asked how my bonus is calculated; I answered correctly that it's randomly determined from either the first or second choices/bets. Question 4 asked about the likelihood of rewards/losses; I answered incorrectly. The correct answer is that one option will give a reward most of the time, and the other will give a loss most of the time, although the reward is probabilistic, and the same option will not always be rewarded in each block. The comprehension check feedback indicated that both my first and second choices/bets contribute to my final score; therefore, both choices should be treated as if they were going to contribute to my score. I have now proceeded to the task, which consists of 5 rounds. I am ready to begin the first round and make my first choice and bet. I have started round 1. The instructions ask me to make my initial choice (A or B) and bet (1, 2, or 3). I have chosen A and bet 2. In round 1, other players' initial choices were: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A.  My initial choice was A and my initial bet was 2. For my second choice, I chose A and bet 2.  The reasoning behind this decision is that the majority of players initially chose A, suggesting it may be the more likely option to be rewarded. Maintaining the same bet reflects my confidence level. In round 1, my second choice (A) was correct, and I gained 40 points (2 * 20). Other players also chose A and had correct choices. I have proceeded to round 2. The instructions for round 2 ask me to make my initial choice (A or B) and bet (1, 2, or 3). I have chosen A and bet 2. My reasoning is that in the previous round, choosing A with a bet of 2 resulted in a correct choice and a gain of 40 points. I will maintain a bet of 2 to reflect my continued confidence in option A. In round 2, I reviewed the other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: B, Player 3: A, Player 4: A. My initial choice was A and my initial bet was 2. For my second choice, I chose A and bet 2.  The reasoning behind this decision is that the majority of players initially chose A, suggesting it may be the more likely option to be rewarded. Maintaining the same bet reflects my confidence level.  The instructions on this page asked me to make a second choice and bet, given the other players' initial choices. I chose A again and bet 2."

In each round, I make an initial choice (A or B) and bet (1-3) on my confidence. After seeing others' choices, I revise my choice and bet. My bonus is partly determined by both initial and revised choices/bets, with feedback only on the second choice/bet (points gained/lost = bet * 20). The total points are randomly calculated from either my first or second choice/bet. I see if others changed choices but not their scores. In rounds 1-3, choosing option A consistently yielded a gain of 40 points. In round 4, my initial choice was A with a bet of 2; other players' initial choices were mixed (Player 1: B, Player 2: A, Player 3: A, Player 4: B). I maintained my choice (A) and bet (2), but this time it was incorrect, resulting in a loss of 40 points. The feedback indicates one option is generally rewarded, but not consistently. The results for round 4 show that my second choice (A) was incorrect, resulting in a loss of 40 points. Other players' results were mixed; Player 1 and 2 chose Option B correctly, Player 3 chose A incorrectly, and Player 4 chose B correctly. I completed a comprehension check with four questions, getting two correct and two incorrect. The correct answers highlight that both my initial and revised choices/bets affect my score. The experiment involves 5 rounds in total.  Round 5: This round requires an initial choice (A or B) and an initial bet (1, 2, or 3).  My choice is A, and my bet is 2, based on the reasoning that although option A hasn't consistently paid off, it seems to have higher potential returns.  The bet of 2 strikes a balance between risk and potential reward given the unpredictable nature of the experiment.  The page contained two questions: the first asked for my initial choice between A and B and the second asked for my initial bet (1, 2, or 3).  The next page showed other players' initial choices: Player 1: A, Player 2: A, Player 3: B, Player 4: A.  My initial choice was A, and my initial bet was 2.  I then made my second choice and bet.  The questions were: Select your second choice (A or B) and Select your second bet (1, 2, or 3). My second choice was A and my second bet was 2."

{
    "confused": false,
    "remarks": "The experiment was well-structured and engaging, although the lack of consistent feedback on the first choice made it challenging to develop a robust strategy. The bonus payment was accurately calculated based on the final score, and the instructions were clear enough.  I believe that the iterative nature of the experiment, combined with the social element of seeing other players' choices, effectively tested decision-making under uncertainty.  I am curious what the underlying pattern was, which would have helped in making better choices. However, the experiment was designed not to reveal this information. One minor improvement might be to clearly state the currency used for the bonus (USD) in the initial instructions, to avoid any potential confusion."
