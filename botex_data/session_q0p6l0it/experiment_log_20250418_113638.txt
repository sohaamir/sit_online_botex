Player 1 chose Option B (correct), Player 2 chose Option B (correct), Player 3 chose Option A (incorrect), and Player 4 chose Option B (correct). Round 4 Instructions: Please make your initial choice and bet for this round, then submit the form. Remember that in this experiment, one option (A or B) is more likely to give rewards than the other, but the better option will change multiple times during the experiment, so pay attention to the outcomes. Questions: id_choice1: Which option do you think is more likely to give you points?  My answer: B (Reason:Given my loss in the previous round and the fact that the correct option changes frequently, I will switch to option B in this round to see if it yields better results. This is a strategic move to balance risk and reward and gain more information.). id_bet1: How confident are you in your choice? My answer: 2 (Reason:In round 3, my bet of 2 proved too risky and resulted in a loss.  To cautiously explore in this round, I will reduce my bet to 2,  while maintaining a potential for reasonable reward, but with lowered risk.). Round 4 - Other Players' Initial Choices and making you Second Choice and Bet. Instructions: You will now see what the other players chose. After reviewing their choices, you can make your second choice and bet. Other Players' Choices: Player 1: Option A, Player 2: Option A, Player 3: Option B, Player 4: Option A. My Initial Decision: Option B, Bet 2. Questions: id_choice2: Which option is more likely to give you points? Answer: A (Reason: Although the choices were split, the majority (3 out of 4 players) chose A. Considering this social information, I will switch back to A in this round.). id_bet2: How confident are you in your choice? Answer: 2 (Reason: The other players' choices were split between A and B, indicating uncertainty. A moderate bet balances the risk and reward, allowing me to gather information without significant loss.  I am also slightly less confident after my incorrect answer in the previous round.). Round 4 Results: My second choice was Option A. This choice was correct. I gained 40 points in this round. Other Players' Results: Player 1: Option A (Correct), Player 2: Option A (Correct), Player 3: Option A (Correct), Player 4: Option B (Incorrect). Round 5 - First Choice and Bet. Instructions: Please make your initial choice and bet for this round, then submit the form. Remember that in this experiment, one option (A or B) is more likely to give rewards than the other, but the better option will change multiple times during the experiment, so pay attention to the outcomes.

    "summary": "This study investigates learning and decision-making in social contexts, focusing on group dynamics and individual psychological differences. Participants engage in a game involving choices and bets, preceded by instructions and practice, followed by questionnaires. The study takes about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes for the game and practice, and 15 minutes for the questionnaires). Compensation includes \u00a310 per hour for completing both sections and a performance-based bonus of up to \u00a33.  The game involves repeatedly choosing between option A or B, with the better option changing throughout.  Bets range from 1 (20 points), 2 (40 points), and 3 (60 points). My participation involved several rounds.  Round 1: Initial choice A, bet 1; second choice A, bet 2 (40 points gained). Round 2: Initial choice A, bet 2; second choice A, bet 2 (40 points gained). Round 3: Initial choice A, bet 2; second choice A, bet 1 (-20 points lost). Round 4: Initial choice B, bet 2; second choice A, bet 2 (40 points gained). Round 5: Initial choice B, bet 2; second choice A, bet 2 (40 points gained).  My decisions were influenced by other players' choices and the changing optimal option. My final score was 140 points, resulting in a bonus payment of \u00a30.23. The experiment aimed to understand brain mechanisms underlying learning and decision-making. My choices involved considering risk, reward, and the behavior of other players.  The experiment was completed. The next step is to proceed to the next button to complete the survey."

{
    "confused": false,
    "remarks": "The experiment was well-structured and engaging. The instructions were clear, and the game mechanics were easy to understand.  The integration of the summary across prompts ensured consistency and allowed for a comprehensive record of my participation. The JSON format for responses worked efficiently.  My only suggestion would be to explicitly state the unit of the points in the instructions.  Overall, the process was well designed and smoothly executed."
