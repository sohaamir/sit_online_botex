Compensation includes \\u00a310 per hour for completing both parts, plus a possible performance-based bonus of up to \\u00a33. Participation may contribute to understanding brain mechanisms underlying learning and decision-making. Round 1 involved making an initial choice (A or B) and a bet (1, 2, or 3). Higher bets mean higher potential rewards, but also higher potential losses. The better option changes multiple times throughout the experiment. My initial choice was A (reason: arbitrary starting point) and my bet was 1 (reason: starting small). Round 1 - Other Players' Initial Choices and making you Second Choice and Bet. Other players' choices were: Player 1: Option A, Player 2: Option A, Player 3: Option B, Player 4: Option A. My initial choice was A, initial bet was 1. Based on the other players' choices, my second choice is A (reason: most players chose A), and my second bet is 2 (reason: slight increase in bet to potentially improve rewards without excessive risk). Bet options are: Bet 1: Win/lose 20 points, Bet 2: Win/lose 40 points, Bet 3: Win/lose 60 points. Round 1 Results: My second choice (Option A) was correct, and I gained 40 points.

My choice for Round 2 is A (reason: continuing with the successful option from the previous round). My bet for Round 2 is 2 (reason: maintaining a moderate bet to balance potential reward and risk).Round 2 - Other Players' Initial Choices and making you Second Choice and Bet. Instructions: You will now see what the other players chose. After reviewing their choices, you can make your second choice and bet. Other Players' Choices: Player 1: Option A, Player 2: Option B, Player 3: Option A, Player 4: Option A. Your Initial Decision: Your initial choice was: Option A, Your initial bet was: 2. Your Second Choice: Based on the other players' choices, you can now make a second choice. Which option do you think is more likely to give you points? Select your choice: A. Your Second Bet: How confident are you in your second choice? Higher bets mean higher potential rewards, but also higher potential losses: Bet 1: Win/lose 20 points (for Correct/Incorrect answer), Bet 2: Win/lose 40 points (for Correct/Incorrect answer), Bet 3: Win/lose 60 points (for Correct/Incorrect answer). Select your bet: 2. Questions and Answers: id_choice2: Answer: A, Reason: Most players chose A, and the previous round's choice of A was successful. Following the majority choice provides a higher chance of success. id_bet2: Answer: 2, Reason: Maintaining a moderate bet to balance potential reward and risk, given that the previous moderate bet in round 1 was successful. Also, observing the other players' choices and adjusting the bet based on the uncertainty of the choice. Round 2 Results: My second choice was Option A, which was correct, and I gained 40 points. Other players' results: Player 1 (Option A, Correct), Player 2 (Option A, Correct), Player 3 (Option B, Incorrect), Player 4 (Option A, Correct).
