prompts.py - Prompts for roles in the experiment

This script sets the prompts for LLM bots in the experiment, based on specific roles.

We split the prompts into three main categories:
1. General instructions that apply to both questionnaires and tasks
2. Questionnaire-specific instructions
3. Task-specific instructions

General instructions are always included, while questionnaire and task instructions are added based on the roles specified (e.g., patient, typical, risk-prone, risk-averse). The roles are set in `player_models.csv`.
