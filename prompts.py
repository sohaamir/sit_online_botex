IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- Always use double quotes for strings
- Answer values must match the question type exactly
- For choice questions: answer "A" or "B" 
- For bet questions: answer 1, 2, or 3 (as numbers, not strings)
- For radio buttons: use the exact text from the options
- Keep reasoning brief but clear
- Set confused to true only if you genuinely don't understand the instructions
