    <h2>Comprehension Check Results</h2>
    
    {% if all_correct %}
    <p><strong>Congratulations! All your answers were correct. You have passed the comprehension test.</strong></p>
    {% else %}
    <p><strong>Some of your answers were incorrect. Please review the feedback below before proceeding.</strong></p>
    {% endif %}
    
    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>You make a first bet of 2, but change to 3 for your second bet. You do not change your chosen option. During the round feedback you learn that the option chosen was not rewarded on this trial.</p>
    <p>How many points do you earn/lose for your second choice?</p>
    
    <p>Your answer: {{ q1_answer }}</p>
    
    {% if q1_correct %}
    <p><strong>Correct!</strong> Because the image was not rewarded, you lose a base of 20 points. This is then multiplied by the second bet (3) so you lose 60 points.</p>
    {% else %}
    <p><strong>Incorrect.</strong> The correct answer is: minus 60 points. Because the image was not rewarded, you lose a base of 20 points. This is then multiplied by the second bet (3) so you lose 60 points.</p>
    {% endif %}
    
    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>This is a catch question. Please select Option 3.</p>
    
    <p>Your answer: {{ q2_answer }}</p>
    
    {% if q2_correct %}
    <p><strong>Correct!</strong> This was a catch question to ensure you were paying attention.</p>
    {% else %}
    <p><strong>Incorrect.</strong> This was a catch question and the correct answer is: Option 3.</p>
    {% endif %}
    
    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>Which of the following accurately describes how your bonus payment is calculated?</p>
    
    <p>Your answer: {{ q3_answer }}</p>
    
    {% if q3_correct %}
    <p><strong>Correct!</strong> Whether your first choice/bet or second choice/bet is chosen is randomly determined on each trial, so choose appropriately for both!</p>
    {% else %}
    <p><strong>Incorrect.</strong> The correct answer is: From either the first and second choices/bets but randomly on each trial. Whether your first choice/bet or second choice/bet is chosen is randomly determined on each trial.</p>
    {% endif %}
    
    <h3>Question 4</h3>
    <p>Which accurately describes how likely the images will give a reward/loss in each block?</p>
    
    <p>Your answer: {{ q4_answer }}</p>
    
    {% if q4_correct %}
    <p><strong>Correct!</strong> Yes, within each block, one image will be more likely than not to give you points (but will sometimes give a loss) whilst the other is more likely than not to give you a loss (but will sometimes reward you).</p>
    {% else %}
    <p><strong>Incorrect.</strong> The correct answer is: One option will give you a reward most of the time, and the other will give you a loss most of the time. Within each block, one image will be more likely to give you points (but will sometimes give a loss) whilst the other is more likely to give you a loss (but will sometimes reward you).</p>
