        <p>You will be playing with <b>four other players in real time</b>, who will also make the same choices.</p>
        
        <p><b>However, there is no competition or co-operation with other players, your aim is solely to maximise the amount of points that you score</b>
        which will be converted into a bonus payment at the end of the experiment. The more points you score, the higher your bonus payment will be!</p>
