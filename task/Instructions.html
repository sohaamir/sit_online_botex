    <h2>Task Overview</h2>
    
    <p>In this experiment, you will make a series of choices between two options, one of which will reward you by giving you points, whilst the other will reduce your score.</p>
    
    <p>You will be playing with four other players in real time, who will also make the same choices.</p>
    
    <p>However, there is no competition or cooperation with other players. Your aim is solely to maximize the amount of points that you score, which will be converted into a bonus payment at the end of the experiment. 
        The more points you score, the higher your bonus payment will be!</p>
    
    <h3>Initial Choice and Bet</h3>
    
    <p>At the beginning of each round, you will make your first choice for which option you think will give you points.</p>
    
    <p>You will then be asked to place a 'bet' as to how confident you are that the option selected is the option that will give you points. You cannot change your bet once it is made.</p>
    
    <p>This should reflect your confidence: "1" (not confident), "2" (reasonably confident), or "3" (very confident)</p>
    
    <p>Whilst you do not receive feedback on whether your first choice is 'correct', your bonus payment will be partly determined by your first choice and bet. 
        It is therefore important to make your first choice and bet appropriately to maximize your bonus.</p>
    
    <p>The other four players in the group will be making choices and bets at the same time as you. After you have made your choice and bet, the choices of the other players in the group will then be revealed.</p>
    
    <h3>Second Choice and Bet</h3>
    
    <p>After the choices for the other players have been displayed, you are presented with the opportunity to revise your first choice and bet by making a second choice and second bet, before being presented with the results for yourself and others in the group.</p>
    
    <p>You will firstly be asked to make a second choice, which may be the same or different to your first choice.</p>
    
    <p>You will then be asked to make your second bet, which can be the same or different to your first bet.</p>
    
    <p>Again this should reflect your confidence: "1" (not confident), "2" (reasonably confident), or "3" (very confident)</p>
    
    <p>Your bonus payment is also partly determined by your second choice and bet. It is therefore important to make your second choice and bet appropriately to maximize your bonus.</p>
    
    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    
    <p>You will receive feedback for your second choice/bet as well as the second choices made by others within the group.</p>
    
    <p>You will be shown the amount of points gained or lost for that round. The amount of points displayed represents your second choice and second bet only.</p>
    
    <p>As with the first bet, it is important that you also make your second bet appropriately based on how confident you are.</p>
    
    <p>For example, if you bet '3' and win, you will receive 60 points, but if you bet '3' and lose, you will lose 60 points (as the bet is multiplied by 20).</p>
    
    <p>Conversely, if you bet '1' and win, you will only receive 20 points, but if you bet '1' and lose, you will only lose 20 points.</p>
    
    <p>Remember that your points score corresponding to your bonus payment is calculated randomly from either your first choice/bet or your second choice/bet on each round. 
        Feedback is only given for your second choice/bet so you can learn which option is being rewarded, but this does not necessarily reflect your points total. You should ultimately treat both choices and bets as if they were going to contribute to your score.</p>
    
    <p>You will also see the second choice for all the other players in the group (so you can determine whether they changed their choice) and an icon indicating whether they won or lost. However, you will not see how much they gained or lost.</p>
    
    <p>After this, you will move onto the next round, where you will start again by making a new first choice. There are a total of 5 rounds.</p>
