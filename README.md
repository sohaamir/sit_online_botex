# Reaction Times

This README file describes the reaction times measured for each Player and Group in the experiment. The reaction times are captured at various stages of the task and provide insights into the timing of different actions and events. All reaction times are measured in milliseconds (ms) and are rounded to two decimal places for precision.

## Player Reaction Times

1. `player.my_page_load_time`: The time taken for the `MyPage` to load for each player.
2. `player.initial_choice_time`: The time between the `MyPage` loading and the player making their initial choice (selecting either the left or right image).
3. `player.initial_bet_time`: The time between the player making their initial choice and submitting their initial bet.
4. `player.preference_choice_time`: The time between the preference choice being loaded (displayed to the player) and the player submitting their preference choice.
5. `player.second_choice_page_load_time`: The time taken for the `SecondChoicePage` to load for each player.
6. `player.second_choice_time`: The time between the `SecondChoicePage` loading and the player making their second choice (selecting either the left or right image).
7. `player.second_bet_time`: The time between the player making their second choice and submitting their second bet.

## Group Reaction Times

1. `group.my_page_load_time`: The average time taken for the `MyPage` to load across all players in the group.
2. `group.all_players_initial_choice_time`: The time between the `MyPage` loading and all players in the group making their initial choices.
3. `group.all_players_initial_bet_time`: The time between the `MyPage` loading and all players in the group submitting their initial bets.
4. `group.all_players_preference_choice_time`: The time between the preference choice being loaded and all players in the group submitting their preference choices.
5. `group.second_choice_page_load_time`: The average time taken for the `SecondChoicePage` to load across all players in the group.
6. `group.all_players_second_choice_time`: The time between the `SecondChoicePage` loading and all players in the group making their second choices.
7. `group.all_players_second_bet_time`: The time between the `SecondChoicePage` loading and all players in the group submitting their second bets.
8. `group.trial_reward_feedback_time`: The time between the trial reward feedback being presented and the end of the `SecondChoicePage` (i.e., the time taken for players to view and process the trial reward feedback).
